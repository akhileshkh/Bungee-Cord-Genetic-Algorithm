# Bungee Cord Genetic Algorithm
Implements a Genetic Algorithm to optimize a modular Bungee Cord Design with height and G-Force Constraints

Takes in Drop Height, Max G load, and Jumper mass as inputs. Outputs the optimal configuration of modular elements to design the cord to satisfy the constraints. Given the modular nature of this problem, a Genetic Algorithm is effective in finding the optimal solution.

Output format is a matrix where each row represents elements in parallel, and each column represents elements on series.
